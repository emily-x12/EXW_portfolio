# EXW_portfolio
# I have created a starting portfolio with the little/no content
# Links were made clickable and they bring you to each section
# I tried to organize the css as best as possible but it is messy
# The website functions at a basic level
# I have completely changed the look of my portfolio
# I have an about me card with an image and I hope to make that its own page once I verse myself more on functionality.
# I have a card and a link to my first project which is the only assignment I am somewhat proud of. I do not feel good about putting any of my other assignments
# I have a new inactive nav bar that i am planning on making functional.
